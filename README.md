# MarkDownload - Markdown Web Clipper

[![GitHub release (latest SemVer)](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/deathau/markdownload?style=for-the-badge&sort=semver)](https://github.com/deathau/markdownload/releases/latest)

This is an extension to clip websites and download them into a readable markdown file. Please keep in mind that it is not guaranteed to work on all websites.

ðŸš§ This is in the process of being rewritten from scratch. Stuff may not work or be completely out-of-date. Go check out the main branch. ðŸš§

## Installation
The extension is available for [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/markdownload/), [Google Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/markdownload-markdown-web/pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi), [Microsoft Edge](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/hajanaajapkhaabfcofdjgjnlgkdkknm) and [Safari](https://apple.co/3tcU0pD).

To run the development version of this extension, download or clone the repo, then load the `src` folder as an unpacked extension (this process can be googled).
Alternately, I generally test the extension with the [web-ext](https://github.com/mozilla/web-ext) command line tool.

## External Libraries
In order to preserve integrity with released versions of 3rd-party libraries being used, but not have to use some sort of "build" step, I've taken a slightly unorthadox approach.
All 3rd-party libraries used have been downloaded directly from [unpkg](https://unpkg.com/) and added to the [3rd-party](./src/3rd-party) folder.
Also in that folder is a file called [_sources.json](./src/3rd-party/_sources.json), which lists the URLs I downloaded the file from, and the unpkg metadata to go along with it so that integrity hashes can be checked, and double checked against unpkg itself.

I claim no responisibility over the code contained within these 3rd-party modules.

Current 3rd-party modules include:
- [Simple.css](https://simplecss.org/) by [Kev Quirk](https://kevquirk.com/) â€” a simple css framework to shore up the basic style of ui in this extension. ([License](https://github.com/kevquirk/simple.css/blob/main/LICENSE))
- [Readability.js](https://github.com/mozilla/readability) by [Mozilla](https://www.mozilla.org/) â€” a library used by Firefox Reader View used to simplify pages so that only the important parts are clipped, as well as providing extra metadata. ([License](https://github.com/mozilla/readability/blob/main/LICENSE.md))
- [Turndown](https://github.com/mixmark-io/turndown) by [Dom Christie](https://domchristie.co.uk/about/) â€” used to convert HTML into Markdown. ([License](https://github.com/mixmark-io/turndown/blob/master/LICENSE))
- [Turndown Plugin GFM](https://github.com/mixmark-io/turndown-plugin-gfm) by [Dom Christie](https://domchristie.co.uk/about/) â€” a plugin for Turndown to add in strikethrough, tables and task list items ([License](https://github.com/mixmark-io/turndown-plugin-gfm/blob/master/LICENSE))
- [EasyMDE](https://github.com/Ionaru/easy-markdown-editor) by [Jeroen Akkerman](https://github.com/Ionaru) â€” a markdown editor based on CodeMirror used as the basis for the markdown display and editing in the sidebar

## Permissions
The following permissions are requested from the browser:
- `activeTab` â€” Access the active tab to get the content
- `scripting` â€” Run script to modify and grab the content of a page
- `storage` â€” Used to save extension options
- `debugger` â€” For debugging purposes. Will probably be removed before release.
- `sidePanel` â€” For displaying the side panel view on Firefox
- `origins: ["*://*/*"]` (i.e. data on all sites) â€” Requested at runtime (requires user interaction) in order to run scripts on any site to grab its content

## Pricing
This is an open-source extension I made *for fun*. Its intention is to be completely free.
It's free on Firefox, Edge and Chrome (and other Chromium browsers),
but unfortunately for Safari there is a yearly developer fee, so I've decided to
charge a small price for the Safari version to help cover that cost.
Alternately, you can become a GitHub Sponsor for as little as $2 per month and
you can request a key for the Safari version.
Also, even if you're using the free version and you absolutely *have* to
send me money because you like it that much, feel free to throw some coins
